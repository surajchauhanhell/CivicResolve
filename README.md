# Civic Resolve - Supabase Version

## How to Run

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Open in Browser**:
    Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Setup Requirements
-   Ensure you have run the `supabase_schema.sql` script in your Supabase Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting
-   If you see an error screen, please share the error message displayed.
-   The Error Boundary we added will help identify any startup issues.
